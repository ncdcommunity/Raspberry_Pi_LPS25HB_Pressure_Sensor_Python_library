# LPS25HB

The LPS25HB, manufactured by STMicroelectronics, is absolute pressure sensor which functions as a digital output barometer. It is guaranteed to operate over a temperature range of -30 to +105 Â°C. This device comprises a sensing element and an IC interface which communicates through I2C from the sensing element to the application. Possible application include enhanced GPS, weather station equipment, etc.
